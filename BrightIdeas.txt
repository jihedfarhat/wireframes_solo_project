I plan to complete the bright ideas wire frame project provided by coding dojo for my solo project with Python Flask.
a web application for Bright Ideas that utilizes Python and the Flask web framework with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
